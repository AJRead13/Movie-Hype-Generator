# Movie-Hype-Generator
## Description
- The drive of this project was to allow users the ability to easily access related comics to upcoming movies.
- The end results of this project show the abilities of our group to coordinated our efforts in structuring, designing and building a functional web based application that utilizes html, css, and javascript.
- Some issues that we ran into during this project were associated initially with the API's that were chosen for our databases.  After trouble shooting, intiial API choices were replaced with more viable candidates for API databases that we proceeded to use in our final application.
